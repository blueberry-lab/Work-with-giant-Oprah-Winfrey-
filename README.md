## Story
The number one thing you have to do is to work on yourself. I say to my girls all of the time that is your real work is to figure out where your power base is and to work on the alignment of your personality, your gifts that you have to give, with the real reason why you're here.
Fill  yourself up and keep your cup full, keep yourself full.
